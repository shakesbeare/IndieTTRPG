# Using this document
This document is designed to be viewed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as 
a vault and some elements may not work or look as intended without using it. 
This page provides a brief introduction to the system without using any of 
Obsidian's special markdown, but provides links to further reading which lead to 
pages which *do* use Obsidian's features. 

If you are using Obsidian, you should instead use `README_Obsidian` as your 
front page, as the links contained on this page lead to locations on Github, 
whereas the Obsidian README uses internal links. 

If you are new to Github, you can browse through the various sections above (you 
may need to click `Browse code`). 

### Using Obsidian
On a computer, you can click the green `Code` button and then click `Download as 
ZIP` to download the entire repository. You can then extract it and open the 
folder as an Obsidian vault. 

# Design Philosophy 
- Reduce complexity where possible â€“ all rules should be
    explainable in a few, simple sentences.
 - Where complexity must remain or increase, it should do so in an intuitive 
    way which is easily understandable or lines up well with how the real 
    world works. 
- Every level-up should have a meaningful, impactful choice. 
- Every player turn in combat should have a meaningful, impactful choice. 
- Player fun is more important than game balance, except where the lack of 
    balance interferes with player fun.

# Why this system?
We believe that the current state of tabletop rpgs is held back by their history 
as a simulation of reality and that we can have more fun in combat and 
roleplaying by abandoning those roots in favor of solid game design. 
Specifically, some problems that we perceive in other systems include but are 
not limited to:
1. The existence of feats implying you can't do simple tasks without those feats 
(e.g. Distracting performance in Pathfinder 2e)
2. The sluggish gameplay which is encouraged by limiting how many times a player 
can interact with their inventory
3. The lack of agency over a fight when an enemy has overwhelmingly high armor 
class and characters can't hope to hit them
4. Certain sharp edges which are not intuitive which poorly reflect how we can 
experience the world and lead to somewhat less interesting gameplay and 
characters (e.g. intimidation being governed by charisma)

# Introduction to Core Concepts and Differences
The following are brief introductions to the core concepts of this system. Most 
of these descriptions are dumbed down versions of what you would find in the 
dedicated pages for each of these concepts and are intended to give a player 
experienced with tabletop rpg's an overview of how the system works and is 
unique. Below are a few major changes which introduce the experienced rpg player 
to this system. 

- [Ability scores have been removed](https://github.com/shakesbeare/IndieTTRPG/blob/main/README_Obsidian.md#ability-scores)
- [Saving throws have been replaced by rolls of reaction](https://github.com/shakesbeare/IndieTTRPG/blob/main/Playing%20the%20Game/Reaction%20Checks.md)
- [Attacks now automatically hit](https://github.com/shakesbeare/IndieTTRPG/blob/main/Playing%20the%20Game/Making%20an%20Attack.md)
- [Spellcasting has been overhauled and Vancian spellcasting has been removed](https://github.com/shakesbeare/IndieTTRPG/blob/main/Playing%20the%20Game/Casting%20Spells.md)
- [Skills have been overhauled and split into two categories: passive and active](https://github.com/shakesbeare/IndieTTRPG/blob/main/Playing%20the%20Game/Skills.md)
