# Using this document
This document is designed to be viewed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as a vault and some elements may not work or look as intended without using it. This README is designed in standard markdown, but you can find a more advanced front page which utilizes Obsidian features in `README_Obsidian`. Note that this page will likely be updated less frequently and may contain outdated information.

# Design Philosophy 
- Reduce complexity where possible – all rules should be
    explainable in a few, simple sentences.
 - Where complexity must remain or increase, it should do so in an intuitive 
    way which is easily understandable or lines up well with how the real 
    world works. 
- Every level-up should have a meaningful, impactful choice. 
- Every player turn in combat should have a meaningful, impactful choice. 
- Player fun is more important than game balance, except where the lack of 
    balance interferes with player fun.

# Introduction to Core Concepts and Differences
The following are brief introductions to the core concepts of this system. Most of these descriptions are dumbed down versions of what you would find in the dedicated pages for each of these concepts and are intended to give a player experienced with tabletop rpg's an overview of how the system works and is unique.

## Choosing a class
Each player may choose a combat-oriented class as well as a crafting-oriented class, each with their own upgrade paths and resources.

## Ability Scores
Ability scores, as opposed to other systems, do not exist. By Dungeons & Dragons 5e and Pathfinder 2e, ability scores are purely useful for determining how well you roll for skill checks and attack roles, with maybe the occasional rule here or there that directly interacts with it such as multiclass or feat prerequisites. Thus, with some careful planning, ability scores can be safely excised from the game while still maintaining a cohesive feel. 

In this system, your ability to perform a skill is directly associated with that skill. Athletics, for example, is a perfectly fine abstraction of all activities of running, lifting, climbing, etc, without needing the intermediary of the Strength score in the middle of it all.  

## Skills
Skills represent how good a character is at doing a given activity. Most skills govern multiple different activities. For example, Athletics governs all activities which involve strenuous physical activity. Skills are divided into two categories: passive and active. Passive skills cannot be used in an active manner. Conversely, active skills can be used actively or, if the situation calls for it, passively as well.
  
## Improving Skills  
In this system, skills are improved by skill points. Each skill point placed into a skill represents an additional +1 bonus to performing associated actions. The number of skill points you receive per level is based on your class and other skills. Your starting skill points are also determined by your chosen class.

## Mastery Skills
Mastery skills are special upgrades granted to each class which increases their prowess in specialized ways. Each class receives a number of mastery skill points per level and may spend them on their mastery skills. Each mastery skill may be upgraded in a slightly different way. Furthermore, each class may have a different number of mastery skills. Many classes have global mastery skills which are available to all subclasses, but most mastery skills are granted based on the subclass you choose.

# Playing the Game

## Using Skills
When a skill check is performed, roll 1d20 and add the modifier of the associated skill check. Skill checks which are at least 10 points higher than the DC are considered one degree of success better. Checks which are at least 10 points lower, conversely, are considered to be one degree of success worse. Some skill checks do not have degrees of success, in which case there is no benefit for rolling superbly high or low.    
  
## Combat  
  
### Combat Procedure  
Upon entering combat, all involved creatures roll initiative and play proceeds in a turn-based fashion. Initiative represents how fast a creature acts and reacts in combat. Initiative is typically an acrobatics check, representing a creature's fast (or slow) reflexes.

Each creature involved in the combat gets three actions to take their part in the battle. They are also allowed a single reaction to use during another creature's turn, provided the trigger is fulfilled. Saving Throws are not considered reactions.    
  
### Making an Attack
In contrast to other systems, attacks have a very high likelihood of succeeding. All attacks will automatically be considered to hit. When making an attack. Your attack may critically succeed or critically fail. These values change based on your equipment and skills. Ensure that you calculate your critical chances before entering combat so it does not bog down the flow of play.  
  
If your critical chances are extremely high or low, you may have the opportunity to double crit, or more. These rare strikes are extremely powerful and offer twice the bonus (or twice the penalty) of a normal crit. 

### Defensive Capabilities    
In combat, a creature’s armor class is subtracted from all damage dealt to them before it is applied to their health. A creature can also attempt to dodge an attack swung at them to nullify all damage they take, assuming they succeed in an reflex saving throw. Generally, wearing armor decreases your ability to succeed in reflex saving throws related to dodging attacks.  
  
### Casting Spells  
Each spell costs some number of mana points which a creature must expend from their mana pool in order to cast the spell. Generally, a creature's maximum number of mana points is the primary limiting factor to how many spells it may cast in a single combat. There is no restriction placed upon which spells may be cast (there is no distinction between 1st or 2nd level mana points, for example), though more powerful spells require more mana points which would allow fewer casts over the course of the combat. 

Once combat ends, the creature may choose to gain a level of exhaustion in order to regenerate mana points for future combats during that day.    
  
# Exhaustion
Exhaustion measures how tired an adventurer may get throughout their time while adventuring. Each level of exhaustion provides some debuff to the creature, with the 10th level resulting in its prominent demise. Martial characters are able to recover from exhaustion by consuming a pool of points while not in combat.
