# Design Philosophy 
- Reduce complexity where possible – all rules should be
    explainable in a few, simple sentences.
 - Where complexity must remain or increase, it should do so in an intuitive 
    way which is easily understandable or lines up well with how the real 
    world works. 
- Every level-up should have a meaningful, impactful choice. 
- Every player turn in combat should have a meaningful, impactful choice. 
- Player fun is more important than game balance, except where the lack of 
    balance interferes with player fun.

# Building a character
## Choosing a class
Each player may choose a combat oriented class as well as a roleplaying oriented
class, each with their own upgrade paths and resources.

## Ability Scores

Ability scores, as opposed to other systems, do not exist. By `Dungeons &
Dragons 5e` and `Pathfinder 2e`, ability scores are purely useful for determining  
how well you roll for skill checks and attack roles, with maybe the occasional  
rule here or there that directly interacts with it such as multiclass or feat  
prerequisites. Thus, with some careful planning, ability scores can be safely  
excised from the game while still maintaining a cohesive feel.    
  
Beyond that, the very idea of ability scores is somewhat contrary to our  
experience in real life. We do not imagine that our strength can only increase  
so much through extensive training, for example. There are many degrees of  
success in these traits and the system in place in current popular system  
fails to create an effective abstraction of real life. In this system, your  
ability to perform a skill is directly associated with that skill. `Athletics`,  
for example, is a perfectly fine abstraction of all activities of running,  
lifting, climbing, etc, without needing the intermediary of the `Strength`  
score in the middle of it all.  
  
## Improving Skills  
  
In this system, skills are improved by skill points. Each skill point placed  
into a skill represents an additional `+1` bonus to performing associated actions.  
The number of skill points you receive per level is based on your class and other  
skills. Your starting skill points are also determined by your chosen class.

## Mastery Skills

`Mastery skills` are special upgrades granted to each class which increases their
prowess in specialized ways. Each class receives a number of `mastery skill points`
per level and may spend them on their `mastery skills`. Each mastery skill may be
upgraded in a slightly different way. Furthermore, each class may have a different
number of `mastery skills`. Many classes have global mastery skills which are available
to all subclasses, but most mastery skills are granted based on the subclass you choose.

# Playing the Game

## Using Skills
When a skill check is performed, roll `1d20` and add the modifier of the associated  
skill check. Skill checks which are at least `10` points higher than the `DC` are  
considered one degree of success better. Checks which are at least `10` points lower,  
conversely, are considered to be one degree of success worse. Some skill checks do not  
have degrees of success, in which case there is no benefit for rolling superbly high  
or low.    
  
## Combat  
  
### Combat Procedure  
  
Upon entering combat, all involved creatures roll initiative and play proceeds  
in a turn-based fashion. Initiative represents how fast a creature acts and  
reacts in combat and is governed by the agility ability. A critical success on  
initiative results in the creature being placed at the top of initiative order  
and a critical failure results in being placed at the bottom. If two creatures  
tie, their agility modifiers should be compared and the higher result goes  
first. If there is still a tie, both creatures should reroll until there is no  
tie and that result determines the order which those creatures take their  
turns.  
  
Each creature involved in the combat gets three `actions` to take their part in  
the battle. They are also allowed a single `reaction` to use during another  
creature's turn, provided the trigger is fulfilled. `Saving Throws` are not  
considered reactions.    
  
### Making an Attack  
  
In contrast to other systems, attacks have a very high likelihood of  
succeeding. All attacks will automatically be considered to hit. When making an  
attack. Your attack may `critically succeed` or `critically fail`. These values  
change based on your equipment and skills. Ensure that you calculate your  
`critical chances` before entering combat so it does not bog down the flow of  
play.  
  
If your `critical chances` are extremely high or low, you may have the    
opportunity to double crit, or more. These rare strikes are extremely powerful  
and offer twice the bonus (or twice the penalty) of a normal crit. 

### Flourishes

An attack marked as a `flourish`is a particularly powerful and flashy move. Such attacks
add a level of `exhaustion` to the user and only one `flourish` may be used in single
turn of combat.

#### Using crit chance  
  
To determine whether a strike is a critical, roll `1d100`. Subtract your ```critical hit
chance ```from 100 to determine the minimum possiiible roll to critcally hit. Your
`critical failure chance` is simply the maximum possible roll you must obtain to *nooot*
`critically fail`. If your `critical hit chance` and `critical fumble chance` combined  
add to greater than 100, your `critical hit chance` takes priority over `critical fumble`  
where they would overlap.  
  
### Defensive Capabilities    
    
In combat, a creature’s armor class is subtracted from all damage dealt to  
them before it is applied to their health. For example, if Lothric has an AC  
of `5` and he is hit with a `15` damage attack, Lothric only takes `10` damage. A  
creature can also attempt to dodge an attack swung at them to nullify all  
damage they take, assuming they succeed in an `agility saving throw` which is  
compared to the attacker’s attack roll. If the attacker rolls a critical    
success, you take half damage on a successful dodge unless you also critically  
succeed. Generally, wearing armor decreases your ability to succeed in ```agility  
saving throws``` related to dodging attacks.  
  
### Casting Spells  
  
Each spell costs some number of `mana points` which a creature must expend from 
their `mana pool` in order to cast the spell. Generally, a creature's maximum number 
of mana points is the primary limiting factor to how many spells it may cast in a single 
combat. There is no restriction placed upon which spells may be cast (there is no distinction 
between 1st or 2nd level mana points, for example), though more powerful spells require 
more `mana points` which would allow fewer casts over the course of the combat. 

Once combat ends, the creature may choose to gain a level of `exhaustion` in  
order to regenerate mana points for future combats during that day.    
  
#### Differences from other Systems  
  
The idea of spell slots has been done away with. You can learn any spell at any time, but  
know that you may not be able to generate the mana in time to cast it reasonably, yet.    
There is also no longer a distinction made between spells and cantrips. You may consider  
a cantrip a spell which you simply always generate enough mana to cast each turn.

# Exhaustion
Exhaustion measures how tired an adventurer may get throughout their time while adventuring. 
Each level of exhaustion provides some debuff to the creature, with the 10th level resulting in its
prominent demise.
