# Initiative

Upon entering combat, all involved creatures roll initiative and play proceeds
in a turn-based fashion. Initiative represents how fast a creature acts and
reacts in combat. Initiative is typically an acrobatics check, representing a
creature's fast (or slow) reflexes. However, when applicable, another skill may
be used in its place. The GM may also rule that a creature's last roll will be
its initiative score, whether that roll was a skill check or not. 

A critical success on an initiative roll results in the creature being placed
at the top of initiative order and a critical failure results in being placed
at the bottom. If two creatures tie, they should each reroll a flat check to
determine which of the two goes first. If there is still a tie, both creatures
should reroll until there is no tie and that result determines the order which
those creatures take their turns.
