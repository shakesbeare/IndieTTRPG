# Casting Spells
Each spell costs some number of mana points which a creature must expend from their mana pool in order to cast the spell. Generally, a creature's maximum number of mana points is the primary limiting factor to how many spells it may cast in a single combat. There is no restriction placed upon which spells may be cast (there is no distinction between 1st or 2nd level mana points, for example), though more powerful spells require more mana points which would allow fewer casts over the course of the combat. 

Once combat ends, the creature may choose to gain a level of [[exhaustion]] in order to regenerate mana points for future combats during that day.
