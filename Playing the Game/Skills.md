# Skills
Skills represent how good a character is at doing a given activity. Most skills govern multiple different activities. For example, Athletics governs all activities which involve strenuous physical activity. Skills are divided into two categories: passive and active. Passive skills cannot be used in an active manner. Conversely, active skills can be used actively or, if the situation calls for it, passively as well. An active skill may be used as a passive skill by taking the characters modifier and adding 10 to it.
