# Making an Attack
All attacks will automatically be considered to hit. When making an attack. Your attack may critically succeed or critically fail. These values change based on your equipment and skills. Ensure that you calculate your critical chances before entering combat so it does not bog down the flow of play.  
  
If your critical chances are extremely high or low, you may have the opportunity to double crit, or more. These rare strikes are extremely powerful and offer twice the bonus (or twice the penalty) of a normal crit. 

#### Flourishes
An attack marked as a flourish is a particularly powerful and flashy move. Such attacks add a level of exhaustion to the user and only one flourish may be used in single turn of combat.

#### Using crit chance  
To determine whether a strike is a critical, roll 1d100. Subtract your critical hit chance from 100 to determine the minimum possiiible roll to critcally hit. Your critical failure chance is simply the maximum possible roll you must obtain to *not* critically fail. If your critical hit chance and critical fumble chance combined add to greater than 100, your critical hit chance takes priority over critical fumble where they would overlap.
