# Mastery Skills

Mastery skills are special upgrades granted to each class which increases their
prowess in specialized ways. Each class receives a number of mastery skill
points per level and may spend them on their mastery skills. Each mastery skill
may be upgraded in a slightly different way. Furthermore, each class may have a
different number of mastery skills. Many classes have global mastery skills
which are available to all subclasses, but most mastery skills are granted
based on the subclass you choose.

- Each mastery skill is capped at having a maximum number of points equal to 4
  times your class level. 
- When multiclassing, mastery skill points can only be used towards mastery
  skills of the same class
