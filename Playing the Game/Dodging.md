# Dodging
When attacked, a creature may attempt to dodge the attack in order to nullify all incoming damage. To do this, the creature must make a reflex saving throw. The result of this save is compared to a new roll from the attacker which is equivalent to an Athletics check for melee physical attacks, an Acrobatics check for ranged physical attacks, or an Arcana check for magical attacks.
