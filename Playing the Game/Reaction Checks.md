# Reaction Checks
Similar to saving throws from other systems, reaction checks occur when your character must act quickly or suffer some negative effect. Whether they must dodge out of the way, catch a dangerous vial, resist poison, or fortify their mind against magics, all reaction checks represent the character consciously or subconsciously dealing with some external negative effect. 

Each character has a number associated with how good they are at reactions. This *reaction modifier* can be either positive or negative and represents not only the reaction time of a character but also their skill at the action in knowing what to do. You can imagine that an untrained person might be able to react very fast, but may dodge in such a way that they simply don't actually get out of the way of the attack. 

For example, the [[fireball]] spell prompts an agility reaction check which represents the targeted creature's ability to move out of the way or get behind cover to reduce damage from the spell. In this case, the targeted creature would roll a d20 and add their agility modifier as well as their reaction modifier and compare that to the DC necessary for the spell.
