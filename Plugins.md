# Plugins

In order to properly use all of the features in this vault, is is recommended
that you install the `Dataview` plugin. 

### Installing plugins

You can install plugins by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left, and
navigating to `Community Plugins`. From there, you'll need to accept the risks
and enable community plugins. Finally, you can click `Browse` to search for the
plugins you want to install and install them. Be sure to enable them before
returning to the vault to view the content. 

You can be sure you've installed the plugin correctly and enabled them when the
